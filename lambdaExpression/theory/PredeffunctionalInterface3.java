	// 1. Predicate 
	
	//predicate contains single abstract method called test .
	//test method take single argument , and returns boolean value 
	//this is used for conditional checks (alternative to if else)
	//Demo1.java , Demo2.java , Demo3.java is for predicate
	
	
	// 2. function 
	
	//function is a functional interface which contains single abstract method called apply . 
	//apply method take any type of parameter but only one parameter , and it will return a single value of any type 
	//Demo4.java , Demo5.java , Demo6.java is for predicate
	
	
	//3. consumer and 4. supplier
	
	//consumer contains single abstract method called accept() and supplier contains single abstract method called get() 
	// consumer takes single parameter as input but doesn't return any value , it just does some action 
	// supplier doesn't take any parameter but it returns value
